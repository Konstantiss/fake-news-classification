# Fake news classification

- The dataset used for our model is [r/Fakeddit](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03854) which contains both image and text data.

- For the image classification, a ResNet model is being developed to classify between 2 classes (True/False).

- A smaller subset of the dataset is used since there are computational limitations.
